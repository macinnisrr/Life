# Life
Self replication for complete operating systems with domain, device, user,  and device + user + domain specific customization.

This project intends to "breathe life" into a complete, running operating system where life is defined as a system's ability to self replicate and to communicate with other living systems. Computer operating systems already communicate with one another, some would say more efficiently and with less error than the most advanced systems we'd traditionally call "alive", like us humans.

We want to give these operating systems the same ability to self replicate that other living organisms have, so you could say that this is "artificial" life, analagous to AI. This project, however, is unconcerned with the goals of AI, and is merely an easy way to ensure the propogation and therefore lifespan of an operating system. It will be exciting to see what novel methods nature has that we can draw inspiration from, and what we can learn about natural life as a result of our software experiments.
